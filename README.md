# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose of this repository

### Following initial data collection and construction of the data structure behind the PlanMyTrip app, beta testers requested minor modifications to the interactive map (specifically, adding the weather description to the info box).  The goal of the code in this repository is to provide beta testers with a brief but useful summary of the weather information for the stops on their itinerary to inform their planning of a driving, walking, or bicycling trip (in this case, on the western coast of Australia).
